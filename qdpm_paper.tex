\begin{abstract}
We study the ground state of the quantum dimer-pentamer model (QDPM) on the square lattice. This model is a generalization of the square lattice quantum dimer model (QDM) as its configuration space comprises fully-packed hard-core dimer coverings as well as configurations containing pentamers, where four dimers touch a vertex. Thus in the QDPM, the fully-packed, hard-core constraint of the QDM is relaxed such that the local dimer number at each vertex is fixed modulo 3; correspondingly, the local $U(1)$ gauge symmetry of the QDM Hilbert space is reduced to a local $Z_3$ gauge symmetry in the QDPM. We construct a local Hamiltonian for which the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) state (the equal superposition of all configurations in a topological sector) is the exact ground state and has a 9-fold topological degeneracy on the torus. Using Monte Carlo calculations, we find no spontaneous symmetry breaking in the RK wavefunction and that its dimer-dimer correlation function decays exponentially. Additionally, we discuss the possibility of $Z_3$ topological order in the ground state of the QDPM.

\section{Introduction}

Over the last several decades, experimental and theoretical work has demonstrated that strongly interacting quantum many-body systems support exotic quantum phases phases of matter not described by the Landau symmetry breaking paradigm. One class of such quantum phases of matter are topologically ordered quantum liquids~\cite{Wen1990}, first realized experimentally via the fractional quantum Hall effect~\cite{FQHE????}. Despite the absence of conventional symmetry breaking and a local order parameter, topological quantum liquids possess a non-trivial quantum order that distinguishes them from trivial liquid phases~\cite{Nayak2008}. Although not detectable by local operators, topological order arises due to a non-local entanglement structure that leaves a signatures in the bipartite entanglement entropy~\cite{Levin2006a,Kitaev2006b}. Such topological phases provide the basis for a proposal for fault-tolerant quantum information processing~\cite{Freedman2001,Kitaev2003}.

Because of the exotic nature of topological phases and their potential use for quantum information processing, there is great interest in the development of theoretical models which display these phases. Such models offer the possibility of furthering the understanding of these phases as well as providing possibly candidate experimental systems in which to constructively engineer topological order~\cite{Duan2003,Jaksch2005,Lewenstein2007,Jiang2008d,Weimer2010a,Herdman2010c,Martinis2015}. A variety of exactly soluble lattice models are known to support ground states with topological order that ranges from the simplest variety, so-called $Z_2$ topological order~\cite{Kitaev2003,Wen2003}, to those with non-Abelian anyonic excitations~\cite{Levin2005a,Kitaev2006a}. These exactly soluble models generally involve complex many-body interactions, and thus it is desirable to find simpler models supporting topological order that are closer to what is accessible experimentally.

Among the simplest class of models displaying topological quantum liquid phases are those with local geometric constraints; the frustration inherent in these constraints inhibits the formation of symmetry breaking local order and given sufficient dynamics, such models may have symmetric liquid ground states. The simplest such geometrically constrained model is the quantum dimer model (QDM) describing dimer degrees of freedom living on the links of a lattice~\cite{Rokhsar1988,Moessner2008}; the hard-core, fully-packed QDM has a local constraint that requires exactly one dimer touching each vertex.

\begin{figure}[b!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{QDPM_ex_config.pdf}
    \caption{Example of an allowed configuration in the quantum dimer-pentamer model.}
    \label{fig:QDPMex}
\end{figure}

While on non-bipartite lattices, the QDM posses a topologically ordered ground state~\cite{Moessner2001a,Fendley2002}, on the square lattice there is only a liquid ground state at an isolated critical quantum point~\cite{Leung1996,Syljuasen2006}. If the hard-core constraint of the QDM is relaxed to a parity constraint such that each vertex much have an even (odd) number of dimers touching each vertex, the simplest non-trivial dynamics lead to the (odd) toric code which has a $Z_2$ topologically ordered ground state~\cite{Kitaev2003,Wen2003}. 

The existence of topologically ordered ground states in dimer-based models is intimately related to the local constraint which imposes a local gauge symmetry in the low energy Hilbert space; the topological order that arises is directly related to a discrete gauge theory with the appropriate local gauge constraint~\cite{Moessner2001}.

Given that these models with dimer degrees of freedom and local constraints posses the simplest non-trivial local (Ising) Hilbert space at each link, they provide a (possibly) simpler route to engineering exotic phases; the local constraints constraint can often be enforced by a local potential energy penalty and the required dynamics are generally expected to arise at the lowest order non-trivial order in perturbation theory. Previous work as demonstrated that GQDM on the square lattice support gapped $Z_2$ topologically ordered phases as well as gapless quantum critical points. On non-bipartite lattices GQDM supported $Z_2$ topological order~\cite{Moessner2001a,Misguich2002} as well as doubled-semion phases~\cite{Qi2014,Buerschaper2014a}. A full characterization of all exotic phases that can exist within this framework is thus desirable.

In this work we extend this paradigm to a new GQDM on the square lattice, what we term the quantum dimer-pentamer model (QDPM). In the QDPM, the local constraint is relaxed from that of the QDM to require that either $1$ or $4$ dimers to touching each vertex, as shown in figure \figref{fig:QDPMex}. Correspondingly, the QDPM extends the Hilbert space of the QDM to include both fully-packed hard-core dimer configurations, as well as those pentamers, four dimers touch a vertex. To give the system dynamics, the Hamiltonian includes terms that incorporate the simplest non-trivial dynamics that don't violate the local constraint.

We present a numerical study of the ground state of the QDPM at an exactly soluble point and demonstrate the the soluble point represents a gapped, disordered quantum liquid phase.  Using Monte Carlo calculations, we explicitly demonstrate the absence of symmetry breaking order and the exponential decay of correlation functions; by computing imaginary-time correlation functions, we find that the RK point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. By construction the QDPM has an exact local $Z_3$ symmetry and conserves a $Z_3$ topological winding number. Thus the QDPM has a 9-fold topological degeneracy on the torus. Thus we argue that the ground state of the QDPM posses $Z_3$ topological order.

This this paper is organized as follows. In \secref{sec:Background} we provide relevant background for the QDM and related models. In \secref{sec:QDPM} we present the details of the QPDM. \secref{sec:MC} provides the results of a Monte Carlo study of the ground state of the QDPM at its exactly soluble point.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:Background}

\subsection{Generalized quantum dimer models}
\label{sec:GQDM}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{example_local_constraints.pdf}
    \caption{Clockwise from the upper left panel we show an example of a QDM with constraints: one
    dimer, two dimers, an even number of dimers, and and odd number of dimers touching each vertex.}
    \label{fig:example_local_constraints}
\end{figure}

Here we will provide background about generalized quantum dimer models on the square lattice. We consider systems with Ising-like dimer degrees of freedom on each link, such that each link has either $0$ or $1$ dimers. The Hilbert space consists of configurations of dimers on the square lattice that satisfy a local constraint at each vertex; the simplest constraint is that of the hard-core fully-packed QDM where a single dimer must touch each vertex. We write this constraint as $n_v = 1$, where $n_v$ is the number of dimers that touch a vertex. We can distinguish between number constraints of the form $n_v = n_0$ and parity constraints of the form $n_v \mod 2 = 0,1$. The unique, non-trivial constraints of this form are the number constraints $n_v=1,2$ and the parity constraints $n_v\mod2 =0,1$ and  $n_v\mod2 =1$ (see \figref{fig:GQDMexamples}).

The presence of such local constraints implies all physical states in the Hilbert space are invariant under local gauge transformations at each vertex, $G_v$. 

The Hamiltonian of a GQDM is of the form
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm{GQDM}} = -t \hat{T} + v \hat{V}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{T}$ is an off-diagonal kinetic term that preserves the constraint, $\hat{V}$ is a local potential energy term, and $v$ and $t$ parametrize the strength of each term. We will take the kinetic term $\hat{T}$ to be the dynamics which preserved the constraint; for example in the QDM $\hat{T}$ is the sum of all possible ``plaquette" flip terms acting on plaquettes with parallel dimers.
\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    \hat{T} = \sum_{\bplqt} 
            \left|
                \vrtplqt
            \right\rangle
            \left\langle
                \hrzplqt
            \right|
            +
            \mathrm{h.c.}
\end{equation}

    Now we will introduce the toric code on the square lattice which will sever as a reference and
    point of comparison to the discussion of the $Z_3$ case. The toric code Hamiltonian is given by
    %
    \begin{equation}
        H_t = -J_e\sum_v A_v - J_m\sum_p B_p
        \label{eqn:toric_code_ham}
    \end{equation}
    %
    where the operator $A_v$ ($B_p$) acts on the vertex $v$ (plaquette $p$), and the sum over $v$ ($p$) 
    is the sum over all vertices (plaquettes). 
    In the toric code, Ising degrees of freedom live on the links of the
    lattice and the operators $A_v$ and $B_p$ can be expressed as
    %
    \begin{equation}
        A_v = \prod_{i\in v} \sigma^x_i
        ,
    \end{equation}
    %
    and
    \begin{equation}
        B_p = \prod_{i\in p} \sigma^z_i
        .
    \end{equation}
    %
    The products are over the links touching vertex $v$ and the edges of plaquette $p$ for
    $A_v$ and $B_p$ respectively. It is not difficult to show that 
    $[A_v,A_{v'}]=0$ for all $v$ and $v'$, 
    $[B_p,B_{p'}]=0$ for all $p$ and $p'$, and $[A_v,B_p]=0$. The comutation relation between $A$
    and $B$ holds even if they share links because they
    can only share an even number of links. Given the commutation relations,
    the toric Hamiltonian can be solved term by term.

    Even without a rigorous solution it is possible to guess at the form of the Toric code
    ground state wave function. The first term in \ref{eqn:toric_code_ham} is maximized 
    when an even number of links touching each vertex are spin up or down in the
    $\sigma^z$ basis. By coloring the links of all down spins the groundstate will
    contain closed loops. The second term in \ref{eqn:toric_code_ham} is maximized for a
    superposition of loops since $B_p$ flips the spins around a plaquette $p$. The ground state
    wave function is then a superposition of all possible closed loop configurations. 
    %Since $B_p$ is a local operator
    %though the alowed loop configurations are determined by how the sytem in initilized.

    The electric and magnetic string operators are
    \begin{equation}
        S^e_{\Gamma} = \prod_{i\in\Gamma_e} \sigma^x_i
        ,
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        S^m_{\Gamma} = \prod_{i\in\Gamma_m} \sigma^z_i
        ,
    \end{equation}
    where the path is denoted by $\Gamma$. The electric string operator acts along the
    links whereas the magnetic string operator acts along a path that perpendicularly
    intersects the links. 
    Electric and magnetic excitations are created when the string operator acts on an unclosed path. 
    The electric excitations create monomer defects in the lattice at the end of the string, 
    each of defects costing energy of $2J_e$. 
    The magnetic excitations, which are 
    are variational excited states  orthogonal
    to the groundstate, create excitations at the ends in the ceter of two plaquettes.
    Each end of the magnetic
    string, a vison, costs energy of $2J_m$. 

    operating on a nontrivial path (genus of system $>0$) with $S_e$ changes the topological sector.
    The current topological sector can be determined
    by acting around the congugate path with $S_m$, e.g. on a torus, acting with $S_e$ along a
    path that encloses the major or minor axis changes the topological sector and acting on a path
    that encloses the minor axis with $S_m$ measures the topological sector.
    As defined the magnetic string can only produce two different values called winding number.
    Therefore, there are $4^g$ topological sectors on the torus where $g$ is the
    genus of the system. 


    \subsection{$Z_3$ Toric Code on the Square Lattice}
        In the $Z_3$ toric three degrees of freedom live on each link.
        We can represent the $Z_3$ algebra through the following expressions
        %
        %Z_N
        %\begin{equation}
        %    E |n\rangle = n |n\rangle, ~ n=0,1,2,...,N-1
        %    \\
        %    e^{iA} |n\rangle = |n+1 \rangle, ~ n=0,1,2,...,N-2
        %    \\
        %    e^{iA} |N-1\rangle = |0\rangle
        %    %\label{eqn:}
        %\end{equation}
        %Z_3
        %
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
            & E_l |n_l\rangle = n_l |n_l\rangle, ~ n_l=0,1,2
            \\
            & e^{iA_l} |n_l \rangle = |n_l+1 \rangle, ~ n_l =0,1
            \\ 
            & e^{iA_l} |2 \rangle = |0\rangle
            \end{split}
            ,
            %\label{eqn:}
        \end{equation}
        %
        where the operators $E_l$ and $A_l$ act on a given link $l$ and are analogous to the 
        electric field and vector potential respectively. 
        By assigning orientations to the links between two vertices we can define the three degrees of
        freedom pictorially. 
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\vvemptylink$ 
            \item $\rightarrowlink$ 
            \item $\leftarrowlink$ 
        \end{itemize}
        % 
        To simplify notation, we define $e^{iA_l}$ as the operator $Q$ which acts on the links in the
        following way
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                & Q^\dagger_{vv'}  | \vvemptylink \rangle = | \rightarrowlink \rangle
                ,
                \\
                & Q^\dagger_{vv'}  | \rightarrowlink \rangle = | \leftarrowlink \rangle
                ,
                \\
                & Q^\dagger_{vv'}  | \leftarrowlink \rangle = | \emptylink \rangle
                .
            \end{split}
            %\label{eqn:}
        \end{equation}
        The link is specified by the two vertices it connects. The operator
        $Q^\dagger_{vv'}$ acts in the direction from the first subscript to the second subscript, in
        this case denoted as $v$ and $v'$. 
        Changing the direction in which $Q$ operates is equivalent to taking the hermitian conjugate
        of the operator withougt changing the direction.  
        %
        \begin{equation}
            (Q^\dagger_{vv'})^\dagger = Q_{vv'}^\dagger
            .
            %\label{eqn:}
        \end{equation}

        We now define an operator $E_{vv'}$ in a similar way, 
        %
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                & E^\dagger_{vv'}  | \vvemptylink \rangle = 0
                ,
                \\
                & E^\dagger_{vv'}  | \rightarrowlink \rangle = | \rightarrowlink \rangle
                ,
                \\
                & E^\dagger_{vv'}  | \leftarrowlink \rangle = 2| \leftarrowlink \rangle
                ,
            \end{split}
            %\label{eqn:}
        \end{equation}
        and with it define the last important operator that acts on the links. 
        %
        \begin{equation}
            P_{vv'}^\dagger \equiv e^{i2\pi E_{vv'}/3}
            .
            %\label{eqn:}
        \end{equation}
        %
        $P_{vv'}^\dagger$ acts on the links in the following way: 
        %
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                & P^\dagger_{vv'}  | \vvemptylink \rangle = | \vvemptylink \rangle
                ,
                \\
                & P^\dagger_{vv'}  | \rightarrowlink \rangle = e^{i2\pi/3} | \rightarrowlink \rangle
                ,
                \\
                & P^\dagger_{vv'}  | \leftarrowlink \rangle = e^{-i2\pi/3} | \leftarrowlink \rangle
                .
            \end{split}
            %\label{eqn:}
        \end{equation}

        With the above definitions the $Z_3$ toric code Hamiltonian can be written in terms of the $P$ and $Q$ operators.
        In general a string net Hamiltonian might be written as 
        \begin{equation}
            H = - J_e \sum_v A_v - J_m \sum_p B_p
            %\label{eqn:}
        \end{equation}
        where 
        \begin{equation}
            A_v = \prod_{i\in v} P^\dagger_{vv_i}~,~ B_p = \prod_{i\in p} Q^\dagger_{v_iv_{i+1}}
            .
            %\label{eqn:}
        \end{equation}
        The specific vertex and plaquette labeling scheme is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vertex_link_labels}.

        For the ground state of this Hamiltonian there is aa local symmetry corresponding to the
        minimization of the first term. This local symmetry is a gauge symmetry that can be
        expressed in terms of the gauge operator.
        \begin{equation}
            G_v | \psi \rangle= | \psi \rangle

        \end{equation}
        where $G_v$ = $A_v$.


        \subsubsection{$Z_3$ String operators}
            With the above notation we can now write down the $Z_3$ string operators. The electric string operator along
            the path $\Gamma$ is written
            %
            \begin{equation}
                S^e_{\Gamma} = \prod_{l=0}^{N-2} Q_{v_lv_{l+1}}^\dagger
                %\label{eqn:}
                ,
            \end{equation}
            %
            where $v_l \in \Gamma$ and $N$ is the number of vertices in $\Gamma$. We show an example of an
            electric string operator operatiing on an example configuration in Fig.~\ref{fig:example_elec_string}.
            %
            %

                \caption{The grey line is the path $\Gamma$ on which the string operator acts. The operator acts
            in the direction from the vertex labeled in red to the one labeled in blue.}
                \label{fig:example_elec_string}
            \end{figure}
            %
            %
            The magnetic string operator can be written as
            \begin{equation}
                S^m_{\Gamma} = \prod_{l=0}^{N-1} P_{v_{2l}v_{2l+1}}^\dagger
                %\label{eqn:}
            \end{equation}
            %
            where $v_l$ are the vertices adjacent to the links in $\Gamma$ and $N$ is the number of
            vertices
            on the \textit{left} side of the path when looking along the path from red to blue. 
            An example of this operator acting
            on a configuration is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:example_mag_string} along with the vertex labeling
            scheme.
            %

            %
            The magnetic string operator acting on path $\Gamma$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:example_mag_string} is
            %
            \begin{multline}
                S^m_{\Gamma} (\mathrm{~Fig.~\ref{fig:example_mag_string}~config})
                = P_{v_0v_1}^\dagger P_{v_2v_3}^\dagger P_{v_4v_5}^\dagger
                \\
                = \exp{[0 - \frac{i2\pi}{3} + \frac{i2\pi}{3} ]} 
                = 1 (\mathrm{~Fig.~\ref{fig:example_mag_string}~config})
                .
            \end{multline}
            %

            An interesting property of the electric string operator in the $Z_3$ toric code is
            that an unclosed string produces two different defects. 
            An example of an open string and the defects is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:example_elec_string}. The
            configuration in Fig.~\ref{fig:example_elec_string}(a) obeys the local gauge symmetry
            aside from the endpoints of the path that it acts on ($\Gamma$). The two defects at the
            end points produce two different values when the vertecies are operated on by $G_v$, being
            $G_{\mathrm{red}} = e^{i2\pi /3}$, and $G_{\mathrm{blue}} = e^{-i2\pi /3}$. 

            The magnetic excitations, or $Z_3$ visons live at the endpoints of the magnetic
            strings.  These visons can change the phase of a configuration by different values.
            


%        \subsubsection{properties of $Z_3$ string operators}

        \subsubsection{Winding Numbers}

            The ground state of the $Z_3$ toric code has nine-fold topological degeneracy because of
            the $3\times3$ different topological sectors. As the case of the toric code the $Z_3$
            electric string changes the topological sector when acting on on a nontrivial closed
            path. We call the electric winding
            operator that acts around the major axis $W^e_y$ and around the minor axis $W^e_x$.
            The topological sector can be determined 
            by acting around the axes with the magnetic string operator, called $W^m_y$ and
            $W^m_x$. All of the winding commute with the Hamiltonian and
            therefore share the same eigenvalues. The operator $W^m_{x}$ ($W^m_{y}$) can 
            have three different values depending on how many electric strings enclose the minor
            (major) axis. The three different
            possible values for each winding number around each axis gives the model nine distinct
            topological sectors.

    \subsection{QDM on Square lattice}
        Here we will review the relevant
        properties and attributes of the QDM on the square lattice for which the Hamiltonian is.
        \begin{equation}
            \label{}
            H_{\mathrm{QDM}} = -t\sum_{\bplqt} 
                \left(
                    \left|
                        \vrtplqt
                    \right\rangle
                    \left\langle
                        \hrzplqt

                    \mathrm{h.c.}
                \right)
            - v\sum_{\bplqt}
                \left(
                    \left|
                        \vrtplqt
                    \right\rangle
                    \left\langle
                        \vrtplqt
                    \right|
                    +
                    \left|
                        \hrzplqt{}
                    \right\rangle
                    \left\langle
                        \hrzplqt
                    \right|
                \right)
                .
        \end{equation}
        This model can be defined in terms of a single parameter $t/v$ for which the wave function is
        known exactly at the Rokhsar and Kivelson (RK) point, the point where $t/v =1$. At the RK
        point the wave function is the equal weighted superposition over all dimer configurations
        and known to be in a critical liquid state with powerlaw decaying dimer correlations. This
        model has an exact local $U(1)$ gauge symetry and is known to be described by a $U(1)$ gauge
        thoery.

\section{The Quantum Dimer Pentamer Model}

    \subsection{Local $Z_3$ Gauge Symmetry}

        In the QDPM Ising degrees of freedom live on the links of the lattice.
        The operator $\hat{\sigma}^x_l$ acts on these links with 
        eigenvalues $\sigma_l = \pm 1$, where $\sigma_l$ is the
        Ising variables of the $l^{\mathrm{th}}$ link on the lattice. The number operator for a give link is
        defined as $\hat{n}_l \equiv (1+\hat{\sigma}_x)/2$ and counts the number of dimers on link $l$.
        An exactly local gauge symmetry exists on the lattice due to the constraint that either one or
        four dimers touch any give vertex. In terms of $n_l$ we can define an operator that counts the
        number of dimers touching a given vertex $v$ as $n_v = \sum_{l\in v} n_l$. 
        
        the local gauge transformation $G_v$ acting on a give vertex $v$ for the quantum dimer model
        can be expressed as
        %
        \begin{equation}
            \label{}
            G_v=e^{i \alpha (n_v - n_0)}
        \end{equation}
        %
        where $n_0$ is the constrained number of dimers touching a vertex, $n_0=1$ in the QDM model,
        The operator $G_v$ then acts in such a
        way that only the physical states, states satisfying the local constraint 
        are invariant. For the QDM $G_v =
        e^{i\alpha (0)}$ and therefore $G_v$ leaves a physical state unchanged for any
        $\alpha$ making the local gauge symmetry $U(1)$. The local gauge transformation that leaves
        only configurations containing dimers and pentamers invariant is
        %
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eqn:gauge_trans}
            G_v = e^{i (\hat{n}_v -1) 2\pi/3}    
        \end{equation}
        %
        For the QDPM $\alpha$ is must be $2\pi/3$ due to the relaxed constraint of the QDM
        model that allows for pentamers. Relaxing the constraint of the QDM brings the local gauge
        symmetry from $U(1)$ to $Z(3)$.

    \subsection{QDPM Hamiltonian}

        We work specifically at the RK point where the ground state wave function
        is an equal weighted superposition of fully packed dimer pentamer configurations
        %
        \begin{equation}
            \label{}
            \left| \Psi \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{\{C\}} \left| C \right\rangle
            ,
        \end{equation}
        %
        where $\{C\}$ is the set of fully packed configurations. The Hilbert space can be defined
        using the gauge transformation in Eq.~\ref{eqn:gauge_trans} as all $\left| C \right\rangle$
        satisfying $G \left| C \right\rangle = \left| C \right\rangle$.

        The QDPM Hamiltonian comprises the QDM Hamiltonian pluss additional terms coresponding to
        the pentamer dynamics.
        \begin{equation}
            H_{\mathrm{QDPM}} = H_{\mathrm{QDM}} + (1-\gamma)\mathrm{pentamer\ terms}
            ,
        \end{equation}
        where $\gamma$ is a single parameter that tunes the relative energy scale of the petamer
        terms to the QDM terms in the Hamiltonian.

        The penatamers pentamer terms are constructed with the dynamics shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:pentamer_moves}.  
        \begin{figure}[htpb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{pentamer_moves.pdf}
            \caption{a) Horizontal creation an annihilation, b) horizontal move, c) and d) are two
            different possible diagonal moves in the same direction.}
            \label{fig:pentamer_moves}
        \end{figure}
        Each of the  moves shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pentamer_moves} can be
        rotated to produce the symmetry related counterpart (eg. vertical creation and annihilation). 
        As an example the creation and annihilation term in the Hamiltonian is
        \begin{multline}
        H_{\mathrm{pentamer\ creation}} = t_{\mathrm{create}}
            \sum_{\bstr}
            \left(
                \left|
                    \hprs
                \right\rangle
                \left\langle
                    \hspr
                \right|
                +
                \mathrm{h.c.}
            \right)
            \\
            - v_{\mathrm{create}}
            \sum_{\bstr}
                \left(
                    \left|
                        \hprs
                    \right\rangle
                    \left\langle
                        \hprs
                    \right|
                    +
                    \left|
                        \hspr
                    \right\rangle
                    \left\langle
                        \hspr
                    \right|
                \right)
        \end{multline}
        where the factors $t_{\mathrm{create}}$ and $v_{\mathrm{create}}$ are the coefficients of
        the pentamer pair creation and annihilation respectively. At the RK point
        $t/v=1$ for each all the pentamer terms. 
        Writing the kinetic and potential energy terms as done above for all the dynamics shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:pentamer_moves} and all of their symmetry related counterparts comprise the
        the pentamer terms of the Hamiltonian. 

    \subsection{Winding operators}

        In the QDPM there is a conserved winding operator in a given topological sector
        \begin{equation}
            W_{x,y} = (N_A - N_B)\mod{3} = n
            .
        \end{equation}
        For $W_y$ ($W_x$), $N_A$ is the number of dimers crossed on a vertical (horizontal) cut and
        $n=0$, $1$, or $2$ depending on the topological sector. The winding operator commutes with
        the Hamiltonian and therefore share the same eigenvalues. Since there are three winding numbers in
        each direction then the ground state is ninefold degenerate.

\section{Spacial Dimer Correlation Results}
    
    In this section we discuss the dimer dimer correlation function
    \begin{equation}
        C_{\mathrm{dimer}} = \langle d_0 d_r \rangle - \langle d_0 \rangle   \langle d_r \rangle   
        ,
    \end{equation}
    where $d_i$ is the ising degrees of freedom on link i.
    In order for the QDPM to exhibit topological order there we must find that it is in a gaped
    dimer liquid phase. It is likely that the QDPM in a liquid phase at the RK point because there 
    we find no evedence of broken symmetries for system sizes up to $32\times32$. As an example of the
    absence of broken symmetries we show
    the dimer correlation function measuered between a single dimer and all other dimers on the
    lattice in Fig.~\ref{fig:fig:dimer_gry_scale_qdpm} for a $16x16$ lattice.
    \subsection{Liquid}

        botom of the figure.}
        \label{fig:dimer_gry_scale_qdpm}

    The dimer correlations decay exponetialy in the distance between the dimers. 
    In Fig.~\ref{fig:spacial_dmr_cor} we show the dimer correlations between horizontal dimers
    in a vertical column. We find the correlation length to be $HERE$.

\section{Estimating the Gap}
    The exponetial decay of the spacial correlations shown in the previous sections 
    implieds a gap in the spectrum though it is important to determine if the lowest lying
    excitations are vison-like
    or the dimer-like.  The energy gap of the dimer-like and vison-like excitations can be estimated 
    by investigating the dimer and
    vison imaginary time correlations respectivly as outlined by Henley \cite{Henley2004a}. 
    One changlenge in this type of gap estimate is in resloving the correlation functions far enough out
    in imaginary time. In appendix \ref{appendix_gap_err} we discuss our methods used to determine
    that this particular source of systematic error is sufficinetly comparied to the gap
    estimates for different types of excitatoins.

    %At the RK point the Hamiltonian is proportional to the matrix of transitions rates the eigen modes of wich describe the time evolution of the
    %system. Since the Hamiltonian and the rate matrix share eigenvalues the lowest energy can be
    %found by looking at the fit of the imaginary time correlations far out in imaginary time where
    %the smalles exponetial dominates.  

    In this paper we only investigate the gap at high symetry points in the Brillouin zone. 
    In Table~\ref{tab:gap_table} we show the estimates of the dimer gap, the double $Z_2$ vison gap
    at $L/2$ and the $Z_3$ vison gap.

    This table shows that the QDPM gap is relativly constant as the system size is increased and
    that the vison gap is lower than the dimer gap. In Fig.~\ref{fig:qdm_qdpm_gap} we show the

\section{Error in the Gap Estimations}
\label{appendix_gap_err}

When estimating the gap by calculating correlations in imaginary time one has to be sure
that the range of imaginary time is appropriate otherwise it is not meaningful to compare the relative 
sizes of the vison and dimer gaps. In
%Fig.~\ref{fig:HERE} 
we show the finite size scaling of the different gaps. For each gap estimation we wanted to reduce
if not eliminate the systematic error due to and inadiquate range of imaginary time. This was
accived by investegating the gap as a fuction of the lower cutoff in the exponential fit of. We
extended the range of $\tau$ until the gap plataued and had little dependence on the cutoff. We show an
example of the estimate of the $Z_3$ vison gap dependence on the lower cutoff of the fit for the
$HERE\times HERE$ lattice with a fraction (HERE) of $0.9$ in 
%Fig.~\ref{fig:}

NOTE: There is also some systematic error in the discritization of time. This error falls off in the QDM
as the number of flippable plaquestts. We assume this error it is small compared to the
statistical error.

\section{Imaginary time Vison Correlations}
\label{appendix_tau_corr}

    \subsection{$Z_2$ Single and Double Visons}
    
        \subsubsection{Single Vison}
            First we distiguish between the single and double vison correlation fuctions. We start with the
            the described by Ivanov \cite{Ivanov2004} for rewriting the single vison correlation function in a
            convieient form to implement numericaly. 
            The correlation function between two point visons $V(\bm{x}_1,\tau_1)$, and $V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_2)$ at 
            points in space $\bm{x}_1$, $\bm{x}_2$ and in imaginary time $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ can be writen as
            \begin{equation}
                C_{\mathrm{single}}(\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1,\tau_2 - \tau_1) = \langle V(\bm{x}_1,\tau_1) V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_2) \rangle
            \end{equation}
            For the $Z_2$ vison $V(\bm{x}_i,\tau_j)^2=1$ and inserting this for $i=2$ and $j=1$ between the two vison
            operators in the above equation we get 
            \begin{equation}
                V(\bm{x}_1,\tau_1) V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_2) = \big(V(\bm{x}_1,\tau_1) V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_1)\big)
                \big( V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_1) V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_2) \big),
                \label{eqn:expanded_z2_v_tau_cor}
            \end{equation}
            
            The first product in Eq.~\ref{eqn:expanded_z2_v_tau_cor} on the RHS is a 
            string operator between two points on the lattice at a given imaginary time $\tau_2$ 
            \begin{equation}
                V(\bm{x}_1,\tau_1) V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_1) = (-1)^{n},
                \label{eqn:simp_z2_vison_phase}
            \end{equation}
            $n$ being the number of dimers intersecting the path between $\bm{x}_1$ and $\bm{x}_1$. This number
            can not depend on the path so one must choose a meathod of ``gauge fixing''. This can be done
            by choosing an imutable bacround configureation which also changes the phase of the
            operator $V_{12}(\tau)$ in the same way as the dynamic dimers. 
            Including the gauge fixing Eqn.~\ref{eqn:simp_z2_vison_phase} becomes
            \begin{equation}
                V(\bm{x}_1,\tau_1) V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_1) = (-1)^{n+n_{\mathrm{backround}}}.
            \end{equation}

            The second product in Eq.~\ref{eqn:expanded_z2_v_tau_cor} on the RHS is a string operator 
            between two points at the location but at different imaginary time $\tau_2$. 
            In order for the full path in space and
            imaginary time to maintain its path independece it can be shown that the phase 
            changes with every plaquet flip at $\bm{x}_2$. So
            \begin{equation}
                V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_1) V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_2) = (-1)^{n_{\mathrm{flipped}}},
            \end{equation}
            where $n_{\mathrm{flipped}}$ is the number of times the plaquette at $\bm{x}_2$ is flipped.
            Finaly Eq.~\ref{eqn:expanded_z2_v_tau_cor} can be expresed as 
            \begin{equation}
                V(\bm{x}_1,\tau_1) V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_2) =
                (-1)^{n+n_{\mathrm{backround}+n_{\mathrm{flipped}}}}.
            \end{equation}
            The gap that is being estimated by looking at the single vison correlatoin function is
            the energy gap of a single vison exciation, only physical when the system has
            boundries but measureable in any system topology. 

        \subsubsection{Double Vison}
            Calculating the doublue vison imaginary time correlation funciton
            \begin{equation}
                C_{\mathrm{double}}(\bm{x}_{12},\tau_2 - \tau_1) = \langle V(\bm{x}_1,\tau_1)V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_1) V(\bm{x}_1,\tau_2)V(\bm{x}_2,\tau_2) \rangle
            \end{equation}
            where the first product on the RHS is the string operator acting along path between points
            $\bm{x}_1$ and $\bm{x}_1$ at imaginary time $\tau_1$ and the second product is the
            string operator along a path between the same points but at $\tau_2$. 

            by looking at the double vison correlation function in imaginary time the gap of a pair
            of visons is extracted.
